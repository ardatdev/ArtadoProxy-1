# Artado Proxy

Artado Proxy is an API that allows users to search the web more privately by sending requests to other search engines, retrieving the results, and parsing them as JSON. This proxy enhances privacy by ensuring that search queries are routed through the proxy rather than directly to search engines. Users can self-host their own proxy and add it to Artado, making it available for others to use as well.

## Features

- Sends search requests to various search engines
- Retrieves and parses search results as JSON
- Enhances user privacy by proxying search queries
- Allows for self-hosted deployment
